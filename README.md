# About me

I have been working on Unix, Mac and PC since the early 1980s.

I have used many different programming languages, but my three favorites are AlgolW, C/C++ and Java.

In October 1990 I proposed my C quine to Richard Stalmann and he included it in the standard gcc distribution..

Of course I have also written a quine for AlgolW.

They are all available in my personal repository PolitePolarBear.
